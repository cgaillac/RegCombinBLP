# RegCombinBLP
We implement best linear predictions in a context where the outcome of interest and some of the covariates are observed in two different datasets that cannot be matched based on D'Haultfoeuille, Gaillac, Maurel (2024) &lt;doi:10.48550/arXiv.2412.04816>. The package allows for common regressors observed in both datasets, including auxiliary variables.
